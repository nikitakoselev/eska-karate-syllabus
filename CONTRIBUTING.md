# Contributing guidelines

Please follow these rules when adding kata, movements or exercises:

- Use the YAML schema: include `name`, `japanese_name`, `movements` (list of step, movement, japanese), `media`.
- Add media files to the kata `media/` folder and reference them by relative path.
- For Anki cards, add rows to `anki/cards.csv` or open a PR with a new CSV.
- Create an issue for major additions or for requests to add/edit media.
