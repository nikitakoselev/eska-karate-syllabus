# Eska Karate Syllabus

This repository stores the Eska Karate syllabus, kata descriptions, belt requirements, training exercises and Anki cards for Japanese names.

Goals
- Collect belt requirements (techniques, kata, knowledge)
- Document kata step-by-step with names of movements, timing and references
- Create Anki-ready cards for Japanese terms (to learn names)
- Include physical exercises, stretching and routines (migrated later to a health-focused repo)
- Provide a browsable site via GitHub Pages (optional)

Repository layout
- `belts/` — per-belt YAML files describing requirements
- `kata/` — one file per kata (YAML) and `media/` for images/video
- `anki/` — exportable CSV and scripts for generating Anki decks
- `exercises/` — mobility, strength, and warmups

How to contribute
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for format guidelines (YAML schema, kata movement naming, media rules).
